## ü§î What is this app about?

Main purpose of this app is to be a replacement for the Taskbar, but in meanwhile I've added more features that can come in handy sometimes. It's not about the 30px you add on your screen, but to limit distraction that comes from flashes, badges, notifications and other apps Microsoft forcefully tries to push to their users.

### You can watch a small demo here:

### **PowerShell Scripts**
You can pin PowerShell scripts for easy access, either write the code directly or make a `.ps1` file and then set as command `Invoke-Item path\to\script.ps1`

### **System Information**
Your CPU and RAM usage.

### **You can change the icon and add a splash image above the menu** if you brand it as your own or to add your company logo.


# **üéöÔ∏è QuickRun**
QuickRun can be launched directly from QuickMenu, just start typing. You can also set a hotkey to open it specifically.

**BE AWARE**: shortcuts always have a space after letters. You can add regex as last parameter. Look at calculator or currency converter.

Consists of:

## Converters
- Calculator: default shortcut is `c `. You can divide multiple math equations with | and use x,y,z,a,b,c as variables. It supports complex equations. Example: `66*20/12` ... `c 75 | x * 20% | x - y | z * 30% | z-a` ... `c 2+3*sqrt(4)`
- Unit converter: Default is `u `. Supports length, mass, temperature, volume, speed, digital, area, energy, force, fuel, power, pressure, shoe, time, torque
Example: `u 1 in to cm` ... `u 1 mass`
- Currency converter: default is `cur `. It uses [fawazahmed0/currency-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api/tree/1/latest/currencies) repository to get latest rates. Example: `cur 100 eur to usd` ... `100$ to eur`
- Color converter: default is `col `. Converts from and to: hex `#` or `0x`, rgba, hsla, hsv, cmyk. Example: `col #ff00ff` ... `rgba(123,255,54,12)`
- Time zones: default is `tz `. Shows current time in specific timezone, contains DTS as well.

## Processors
- **Shortcuts: default is `s `. It is good to bookmark links or search**
- **Memo: default is `m `. Good to save commands, text, info that you might need later**
- Regex: default is `rgx `. You can test regex if you ever need to.
- Lorem: default is `lorem `. It generates lorem ipsum text, Example: `lorem 3 long headers`
- Encoders: default is `enc `. Use ! to encode and @ to decode. supports url, base, rot13, ascii.

## Utility
- Projects: default is `p `. You open your saved projects from Interface. It is good to save older projects or side projects or examples folders, so you do not browse and try to find them manually.
- Timer: default is `t `. Use this to set quick timers, for example for `t 5 tea` to remind you in 5 minutes to drink your tea and not forget it for 4 hours.
- Variable: default is `v `. Use this in combination with Hotkeys if you need to reset a variable.
- Send keys: default is `k `. You can save specific keys and trigger them from quick menu. For example: `k m` to trigger `MEDIA_NEXT_TRACK` if you don't want to stretch your fingers to the random media next track keyboard button.

# **üé® Theme**
You can change the background color, text color and accent color. Also QuickMenu has a slight gradient in the middle, you can change the opacity as well.

You can pick between predefined colors or your own colors.

# **üé∂ Audio**
A main reason I've made this app is to easily manage Audio. You can easily switch between outputs and inputs, change volume from hotkeys and moving your mouse and modify specific app volume.
Another reason is to fix Spotify, that listen to all media trigger and acts upon them, I think this is a marketing strategy of "did you wanted music? we are your music". So I made this functions (that you need to enable from settings):
- When you play an app, Tabame will try to mute Spotify.
- When sound comes from other sources, Spotify will pause.
- A dedicated Button on Quick Actions for Spotify, so if you want to play/pause only Spotify, you can use that.

Each app that makes sound has dedicated media control and you can set default `exe`s that will show them by default.
Also you can modify Volume OSD to hide media, make it thinner or hide it completely.


# **‚å®Ô∏è Hotkeys**
I've tried to make a complex system for hotkeys so with one button you can achieve more.

- Each hotkey has a list of triggers and each trigger is capable of multiple actions.
- You can activate window under cursor so data is sent where you want to.
- You can set a trigger to a specific window by title, exe or class.
- You can set a trigger to a specific region of the window, in pixels or percentage. The region can be anchored in all 4 points of the window.
- The trigger can be:
  - Press
  - Double Press
  - Mouse Movement
    - the trigger can be at the end or while moving.
  - Hold Duration
- You can set a variable check if you need more complexity.

Actions can be:
- Send Keys
- Hotkey
- Tabame Function
- Set Var
- Send Click

Tabame Functions are:
- Toggle Taskbar 
- Toggle Quick Menu
- Show Quick Menu In Center
- Toggle Quick Run
- Show Last Active Window
- Open Audio Settings
- Play Pause Spotify
- Toggle Hidden Files
- Toggle Desktop Files
- Switch Audio Output
- Switch Microphone Input
- Toggle Microphone 
- Switch Desktop To Right
- Switch Desktop To Left

You can set multiple Actions.

Example: With main hotkey, you can open tabame, show previous window, toggle taskbar, open start menu, open `Win+X` menu, open new chrome tab, show desktop, change volume level or switch desktops. You do not need to learn new hotkeys for each thing you need.


# **üìï Projects**
Here you can save your projects, important folders/files, or documentation/example folder.

You can create groups and in them you can add your projects. You can set an emoji for each so you can differentiate between them later when you forgot which is which.


# **üìù Trktivity**
Trktivity track your activity üßê. It records keystrokes, mouse pings each 3 seconds and active window exe and title (if you set filters for it). 

You can view stats per day or a set of days. It generates a graph from 00:00 to 24:00.

It generates a timeline for executable you were focused and for Titles you've created filters.


# **üìÖ Tasks**
Tasks consists of Reminders and Page Watchers. 

Reminders can be repetitive or one time per day. You can set which days of the week to be active and for repetitive reminders you can set interval when the reminder is active. You can set to receive Toast Notification or Audio Notification. You can use `xNR` to repeat the message, ex `Workout x3`.

Page watchers will check a link each to see if specific text exists or not. For example if you made a post on a obscure forum and want to know when you receive a reply, you can set the link, 60 second interval and `\d+ Replies` and when that string changes, you will be notified.

# **‚ú® Wizardly**
Wizardly is a set of tools that works with folders. You can add it in Context Menu for easier access.

## Find Text In Folder
You can search text in a folder, recursively. You can use regex, case sensitive or match the whole text only.

Import feature to this (and why I've created it): You can exclude files/folders, so if you do not want to see results from, for example `node_modules` you can set that in filters. For example Notepad++ and vsCode does not have this feature and it's annoying.

## Project Overview

It counts lines of code and makes a summary. **You can ignore folders or only show specific file types**.

It shows code lines, non-code lines (lines with 1-2 chars line `[]{}()`), comment lines and empty lines.

It also calculates how many books you could have written with same characters. In my opinion it was surprising this project is equivalent of 7 and a half books.

For example, at this time of writing this README.md, Tabame has `27,191 lines` with `761,698 characters` which is impressive in my opinion because I've written it by myself.

## Rename Files
You can rename files in bulk, you can use regex but also Lists. This can be useful when you want to change from **IMG_20220725_121728.jpg** to **25 July 2022.jpg** 

## Folder Size Scan
You can scan folders recursively and see each folder size, you can delete folders.


# üôÉ Outro
I've started this project to learn Dart and Flutter, in my mind I had only `QuickMenu` features/app, but while writing for it I got new ideas for it, and it ended up `Tabame`, random name I came up with.

## If you find this app useful, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/far.se). It would be appreciated üòä.
